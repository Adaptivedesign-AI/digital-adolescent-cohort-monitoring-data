Sometimes I just blast my favorite songs and zone out. \n\nTalking to my friends helps too, but it’s hard to open up sometimes. I don’t wanna burden them with my problems. I usually keep it light, but they can tell when I’m off. And I guess scrolling through memes or funny videos can lighten my mood, even if it's just for a second. \n\nBut yeah, it’s tough.

School feels less like a drag, and I can actually focus in class. I’m just vibing with my friends, laughing at dumb jokes, and feeling like I belong, even if it’s just for a moment. \n\nAfter school, I’m either at practice or hanging out, maybe grabbing food, just enjoying life. I love those days when everything feels light, like I could take on anything. I’m more social, actually engaging in conversations instead of just scrolling through my phone. It’s like I see the world in color instead of gray. \n\nBut those days don’t happen often enough, and it’s annoying. I wish I could bottle it up and keep it around. \n\nEmotion tag: lowkey hopeful",

Explain why you wanna move out and how it’ll help you. But also, be prepared for them to still say no, because they might not get it. It’s frustrating, but they might just need to see that you can handle it. Or maybe find a compromise like, I don’t know, staying with a friend for a weekend or something.

Like, is it just about having your own space, or is there something else going on? Once you know that, you can approach your parents with a clearer head.\n\nWhen you talk to them, pick a good time, not when they're stressed or busy. Just be honest. Share your feelings without sounding all confrontational. Maybe tell them how it feels living at home and what you hope to gain by moving out.\n\nThen, listen to their side too. They might have some valid concerns, and understanding their perspective can help you navigate the convo better. Like, if they’re worried about money, maybe talk about how you plan to cover your expenses. \n\nAnd if they’re still super against it after all that, you might have to show them you're responsible in other ways. Like keeping up with school, doing chores, or whatever. It’s kinda like proving you can handle adult stuff, you know?\n\nUgh, it’s complicated, but just keep being honest and try to keep the peace. \n\nEmotion tag: lowkey anxious",
