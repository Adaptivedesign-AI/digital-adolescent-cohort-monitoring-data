I try to brush it off, but it gets to me, you know? Makes it hard to keep my head up. \n\nI’m just trying to focus on sports and hanging out with friends, but it’s like there’s this cloud following me around. I don’t even know how to deal with it all. \n\nEmotion tag: spiraling",

I also listen to music—so much music. It’s like a mini escape, you know? Sometimes I just blast my favorite songs and zone out. \n\nTalking to my friends helps too, but it’s hard to open up sometimes. I don’t wanna burden them with my problems. I usually keep it light, but they can tell when I’m off. And I guess scrolling through memes or funny videos can lighten my mood, even if it's just for a second. \n\nBut yeah, it’s tough.

I’m just vibing with my friends, laughing at dumb jokes, and feeling like I belong, even if it’s just for a moment. \n\nAfter school, I’m either at practice or hanging out, maybe grabbing food, just enjoying life. I love those days when everything feels light, like I could take on anything. I’m more social, actually engaging in conversations instead of just scrolling through my phone. It’s like I see the world in color instead of gray. \n\nBut those days don’t happen often enough, and it’s annoying. I wish I could bottle it up and keep it around. \n\nEmotion tag: lowkey hopeful",
